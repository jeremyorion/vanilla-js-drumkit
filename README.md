# Vanilla JS Drum Kit

This is my implementation of a vanilla Javascript tutorial by the ineffable [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/). The audio assets and some of the initial HTML and CSS were provided as part of the tutorial. However, the javascript code is entirely my own.

Some changes were made to the provided HTML and CSS, including:
- Replacing `<div>` with `<button>` where appropriate to improve semantics (particularly after implementing some new javascript functionality)
- Style changes within CSS
